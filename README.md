# Zelda like game in C#
 First year's game dev programming exam project.
 
 This game is a zelda like game using A* pathfinding for movement (both enemy and player), finite state machines for enemy behaviours, custom game engine (controllers, scenes, collisions, actors, powerups and bullets), tiled for maps creations and GLSL for some PostFX.
